# Glory to Cards

With people designing their own Print-and-Plays of Glory to Rome,
there have been efforts to try to improve the cards, e.g. for clarity or scannability.
This was created for my own Print-and-Play but with the hope that we can make it easier to share our improvements.

Original card text is believed to come from [batdog's "Glory to Rome Card List"](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/29428/glory-rome-card-list)
The only significant change with [chayashida's "Glory to Rome Card List - updated"](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/122301/glory-rome-card-list-updated)
seems to be to deviate from the name of cards from what is in [rseater's "BlackBox Order Card Fronts"](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/229497/blackbox-order-card-fronts).

["mini"](https://github.com/epage/gtr-cards/tree/mini) is an extract of the card text from
[tylorlilley's "My Custom Glory to Rome: Mini Travel Edition" Print-and-Play](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3073144/my-custom-glory-rome-mini-travel-edition)
with the card name's reverted back to what batdog used
([differences](https://github.com/epage/gtr-cards/compare/blackbox...mini)).
